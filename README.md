# household-consumption

The Household Power Consumption dataset is a multivariate time series dataset that describes the electricity consumption for a single household over four years.

The data, that can be downloaded from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption), was collected between December 2006 and November 2010 and observations of power consumption within the household were collected every minute.

In this project, we are going to explore and understand the dataset using a suite of data analysis tools. This exploration and understanding will help us in framing the prediction problem, the ways the data may be prepared and the modeling methods that may be used.
